# Machine Learning Workshop#

This is a Machine Learning Workshop for complete beginners. 
The talker can teach the basics using the analysis/gamesalesanalysis.ipnyb, and propose for the participants to try and do the same with the titanic dataset. 

This workshop is divided in:
Markup: 1. What do I want to know from this dataset? (and subsequent data preping )
2. Our first clasifier (A simple SVM)
3. Evaluate your classifier (Metrics)

In the gamesalesanalysis some mistakes are made on purpose, so the talker can explain them to the audience, such has:
Markup : *Lack of statistical testing on the features (to analyse correlation to the targets)
* Unbalanced dataset, and lack of methods dealing with it
* Unoptimized classifier

Good teaching!
